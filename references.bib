	abstract = {As machine learning (ML) increasingly affects people and society, awareness of its potential unwanted consequences has also grown. To anticipate, prevent, and mitigate undesirable downstream consequences, it is critical that we understand when and how harm might be introduced throughout the ML life cycle. In this paper, we provide a framework that identifies seven distinct potential sources of downstream harm in machine learning, spanning data collection, development, and deployment. In doing so, we aim to facilitate more productive and precise communication around these issues, as well as more direct, application-grounded ways to mitigate them.},

	abstract = {Traditional methods in handwritten text recognition primarily focus on generating basic transcriptions, which often fall short for in-depth humanities research. Our study enhances this by providing diplomatic transcriptions for German studies, meticulously reproducing the original manuscripts, including layout and expanded abbreviations. State-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence approaches for handwritten text recognition predominantly use Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) as an auxiliary loss of the encoder output to improve robustness and accuracy. This is not possible in this task due to the great differences in the length of diplomatic transcriptions. We propose using the basic transcription instead of the diplomatic one as an additional target for the CTC feedback. Additionally, we introduce positional encoding at the intersection between the encoder and decoder to resolve the conflict of competing encoder objectives, balancing CTC loss reduction with the maintenance of implicit positional encoding for the decoder. Our empirical tests on the newly created dataset “Nuremberg Letterbooks” demonstrate significant data efficiency improvements. With only 4000 training lines (about 130 transcribed pages), we achieve a Character Error Rate (CER) of 9.39\% without expanded abbreviations and 12.07\% with expanded abbreviations, outperforming the baseline errors of 14.26\% and 68.21\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Today, intelligent systems that offer artificial intelligence capabilities often rely on machine learning. Machine learning describes the capacity of systems to learn from problem-specific training data to automate the process of analytical model building and solve associated tasks. Deep learning is a machine learning concept based on artificial neural networks. For many applications, deep learning models outperform shallow machine learning models and traditional data analysis approaches. In this article, we summarize the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning to generate a broader understanding of the methodical underpinning of current intelligent systems. In particular, we provide a conceptual distinction between relevant terms and concepts, explain the process of automated analytical model building through machine learning and deep learning, and discuss the challenges that arise when implementing such intelligent systems in the field of electronic markets and networked business. These naturally go beyond technological aspects and highlight issues in human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence servitization.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at:},
